                The aerodynamics club or AERO D as we like to call it, is a technical club at BITS Goa. Itâ€™s a place where all kind of people from different backgrounds come together to make something out of nothing. To be specific, something that has the ability to fly. Be it as simple as a replica of a WWII plane or as advanced as a <a class="nostyle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTOL" target="_blank">VTOL</a>, we have it all. As a member, I built quadcopters, tricopters, CNC 4axis foam Cutters, and 3D-Printers for fun. In my senior year, I was elected as the coordinator of the club and went on to lead numerous projects.
