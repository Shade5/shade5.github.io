                The evolved laser Interferometer space antenna is a mission proposed by the European Space Agency. It will be used to detect and measure low-frequency gravitational waves in the range of 10<sup>-5</sup> Hz to 1 Hz. The mission is set to be launched in 2034, but a forerunner mission, the LISA Pathfinder was launched on December 3, 2015, to test the technologies that are planned for eLISA.
                In this project, the optimal phases of the spaces-crafts we calculated as follows:

                  <li>Constructing equations to describe the motion of planets under gravity</li>
                  <li>Runge-Kutta 4 for solving the differential equations</li>
                  <li>Estimation of oscillations in spacecraft orbit</li>
                  <li>Optimize oscillation by searching over phase space</li>
                </ul>  
            </p>

                The interactive plot above is the estimated path of the space-crafts around the sun.

                Clearly, a global minimum is observed, which indicates the ideal orbit for the spacecrafts.

                 The orbits were optimized using the plot described above. Since the oscillations are deterministic, the deviations in the gravitational wave readings can be manually removed.
